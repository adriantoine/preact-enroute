Hello! Before sending a pull-request please note the following:

- Please open an issue before adding new features
- Pull-requests should include tests for the changes
- Performance optimizations should provide benchmarks
- Purely subjective stylistic changes will likely be declined
- Unnecessary micro-optimizations will likely be declined
- I don't use NPM scripts sorry :)

Thanks!
